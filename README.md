# Python Projects

This repo contains a few projects I have done utilizing Python which include the following:

### [Hangman](https://github.com/sktorre/python_projects/tree/main/Hangman)
This is some code I wrote to play the game hangman against the computer. The computer randomly selects a word from a set list and the user guesses letters until they get the correct word or run out of guesses.

### [Metric Recalculation](https://github.com/sktorre/python_projects/tree/main/Metric%20Recalculation)
This folder contains a good amount of the code use to import 250GB of data from hundreds of files, clean filter and combined relevant data, perform metric calculations and output the results into a SQLite database. This code was used to assist a client in which I cannot share any client information. Therefore, all of the data and some of the code was removed.

### [Pratice Problems](https://github.com/sktorre/python_projects/tree/main/Practice%20Problems)
This folder includes practice exercises I have completed relating to interacting with a cookbook database.

### [Mahalanobis Distance Calculator](https://github.com/sktorre/python_projects/blob/main/Distance_Measurement_Calculation.py)
This file uses the Mahalanobis distance-based matching technique to match donors and recipients from a given data set. I am not able to publicly share the data that was used in these calculations, but this code could be applied to any list of donors and recipients or any two attributes in which one would like to find the closest distant pairs.
